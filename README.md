- 👋 Hi, I’m @saint-erk
- 👀 I’m interested in fixing issues that bug me. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github and write in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects I use that can be just a little bit better for my use cases.
- 📫 How to reach me ... maybe I'll fill this in once I have commits worth reaching me about.
